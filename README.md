Blockbuster movies bring in billions for the studios behind them, and film entertainment is a multi billion dollar industry, particularly when we add in revenue from franchising. But with production costs that can run into the hundreds of millions, studios must be careful about which movies they invest in. The new media arm of Microsoft, like any other business, should look carefully at the data behind the top office earners in order to make informed decisions about which projects will likely provide the best return. We can determine this by taking a close look at the genres of movies that are most frequently represented within the top quartile of film's worldwide gross, examining the relationship if (any) between film budgets and earnings, and finally examining when to release the film to maximize profits.


### Recommendations

There has been a historically strong market for Action/Adventure films that remains vital. Although investing in such films remains risky- there are significant cost outlays to produce these types of films- but that those risks are very often rewarded with strong box office showings. So where to start? While a large number of the most recent blockbuster films have been based on comic books, there is a largely untapped market to produce these kinds of epic sagas with more diverse cast. As the recent success of movies like "Black Panther" demonstrate, viewers are hungry for films that include characters that better represent the diverse world we live in.
